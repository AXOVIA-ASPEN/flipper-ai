# 🧪 Testing Your Live Deployment

**Environment variables added!** ✅

Now let's verify everything works.

## Step 1: Get Your Deployment URL

**From Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **flipper-ai** project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click on the **latest deployment** (should be building now)
5. **Copy the URL** (looks like: `https://flipper-ai-abc123.vercel.app`)

**Share the URL with me** and I'll run automated tests!

---

## Step 2: Quick Manual Test

While waiting for build (2-3 minutes):

**Once you have the URL, visit it in your browser:**

1. **Landing Page Test**
   - URL: `https://your-url.vercel.app/`
   - Should see: Flipper AI with penguin 🐧
   - Should see: Hero section, features, pricing

2. **Signup Test**
   - URL: `https://your-url.vercel.app/auth/signup`
   - Should see: Sign up form
   - Try creating an account

3. **Login Test**
   - URL: `https://your-url.vercel.app/auth/login`
   - Should see: Login form
   - Try logging in with account from step 2

4. **Dashboard Test**
   - After login, should redirect to dashboard
   - Should see your user info

## Step 3: Check for Errors

**Open Browser DevTools (F12):**
- Click **Console** tab
- Look for red errors
- Share any errors you see

**Common Success Indicators:**
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ No "Missing NEXTAUTH_SECRET" error
- ✅ Pages load quickly
- ✅ Forms are interactive
- ✅ Can create account and log in

---

## Step 4: Run Automated Verification

**Once you share your URL, I'll run:**
```bash
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh https://your-url.vercel.app
```

This will test:
- Health endpoints
- Landing page
- Auth pages
- API endpoints
- SSL/HTTPS

## 🐛 If You See Errors

**"Missing NEXTAUTH_SECRET"**
- Env vars not saved properly
- Go back to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
- Verify both are there for "Production"
- Redeploy

**"Database connection failed"**
- Prisma Postgres integration not connected
- Go to Vercel → Integrations
- Add Prisma Postgres integration

**404 on pages**
- Build might still be in progress
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Refresh

**Blank page / no content**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Network tab (F12) for failed requests
- Share error messages
