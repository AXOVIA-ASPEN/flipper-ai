# 🔗 Integration Test Suite Results

**Generated:** February 17, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ ALL PASSING — 77/77 tests pass

---

## Overview

Flipper AI has a comprehensive integration test suite that validates all 6 core API endpoint groups against a real SQLite database (separate from production `dev.db`). These tests verify end-to-end request → response behaviour, database persistence, and multi-step workflows.

## Infrastructure Fixes Applied (Feb 17, 2026)

The integration test infrastructure required several fixes to work correctly on this environment:

### 1. native `better-sqlite3` Bindings
**Problem:** `better-sqlite3` native bindings weren't compiled for Node.js v22.22.0 (ABI 127).  
**Fix:** Rebuilt the package in-place:
```bash
cd node_modules/.pnpm/better-sqlite3@12.5.0/node_modules/better-sqlite3 && npm rebuild
```

### 2. Test Database Schema
**Problem:** `test.db` existed but had no tables.  
**Fix:** Extracted schema from `dev.db` (which has migrations applied) and applied to `test.db` via Python script.

### 3. ESM Transformation for auth packages (historical, pre-Firebase Auth migration)
**Problem:** `jest.integration.config.js` had a narrow `transformIgnorePatterns` that excluded auth packages from transpilation.  
**Fix:** Updated transform patterns. (This issue is no longer relevant — the project has since migrated to Firebase Auth.)

### 4. Auth Mock for Integration Tests
**Problem:** Tests calling auth-protected endpoints returned 401 because the auth mock returned `undefined`.  
**Fix:** Added auth mock to `integration/setup.ts`. (Auth is now Firebase Auth; mocks target `src/lib/firebase/session.ts`.)

### 5. Value Estimator Business Logic Bypass
**Problem:** The POST `/api/listings` route enforces a 70% discount threshold. Test data with asking prices ~$100 wouldn't pass, returning 200 "skipped" instead of 201.  
**Fix:** Mocked `@/lib/value-estimator` in integration setup to always return `discountPercent: 80` (above threshold), isolating API layer from business logic in integration tests.

### 6. Test Client SQLite Compatibility
**Problem:** The `testPrisma` custom client (in `setup.ts`) had multiple gaps vs. Prisma's actual API:
- No handling for `OR` operator (used for user-scoped queries)
- No handling for `gte`/`lte` operators in `opportunity.count`
- No handling for nested relation filters (`where.listing = { platform: ... }`)
- Non-primitive values (Date, Array, boolean) not serialized before INSERT/UPDATE
- Missing `createMany` on opportunity
- `delete` didn't throw on missing record (Prisma P2025 behaviour)
- `SearchConfig.findMany` didn't convert 0/1 back to boolean

**Fix:** Complete refactor of the test client with:
- `buildWhereClause()` helper supporting `OR`, `gte`, `lte`, `contains`, `IS NULL`
- JOIN-based queries for nested listing filters in opportunity queries  
- Value serialization in all INSERT/UPDATE paths
- Missing methods added (`createMany`, `deleteMany` with where)
- Proper FK-friendly reset with test user re-creation

### 7. FK Constraint on Test User
**Problem:** `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY` — Listing table requires `userId` FK to `User` table, but no test user existed after `resetDatabase()`.  
**Fix:** Added `ensureTestUser()` function called after every `resetDatabase()`.

## How to Run

```bash
# From project root
npx jest --config jest.integration.config.js

# Run a specific suite
npx jest --config jest.integration.config.js src/__tests__/integration/listings.integration.test.ts

# With verbose output
npx jest --config jest.integration.config.js --verbose
```

## Coverage Impact

Integration tests do NOT run as part of the default coverage report (`pnpm test:coverage`). They test the full API layer end-to-end with a live SQLite database. For unit test coverage, see the main README.

**Unit test coverage (as of Feb 17, 2026):**
- Statements: 99.64%
- Branches: 98.22%
- Functions: 99.79%
- Lines: 99.67%
- Total tests: 2,297

**Combined (unit + integration):** 2,297 + 77 = **2,374 total tests**
